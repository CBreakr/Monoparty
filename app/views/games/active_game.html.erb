Banner at the top with messages

The main idea is to have the board as in the template
but in the middle is a space in which buttons for user actions can appear\
    - the spaces would have their color, text, user_pieces, and ownership customized
        - including where the border is placed
    - but their placement and shape would be by default

with info panels for the different players
    - cheat with a little bit of javascript for going between the tabs
        - and/or collapse/expand
